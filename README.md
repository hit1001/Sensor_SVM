# Sensor_SVM
A Machine learning problem where sensor data from 10 different sensors are taken and labelled for 400 samples. Applying machine learning to rank sensor performance on the basis of their prediction score

1) The task_data.csv is comma seperated file containing all the sensor values along with the labels.
2) data.csv is created to randomly shuffle all the rows so that they can be divided into training data sets and test data sets
3) shuffle.py is Python code to do the above step.
4) task.py is the main Python code which calculates the accuracy of every sensor and arranging them in a descending order for better representation.
